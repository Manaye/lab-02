###Project:  Gallery of Horns

Welcome visitor.  This project was created to demonstrate our skills and knowledge in JavaSript, CSS, and HTML.
Big empahsis was put into using jQuery, particularly jQuery Selectors, Events and JSON.

The idea behind this project is to populate the webpage with a gallery of horns given to us in a JSON file.  
Extract that data to be shown on the page.  Have a drop down menu with options to select a particular horn picture.
From the drop down, only those particular picture(s) will be shown.
